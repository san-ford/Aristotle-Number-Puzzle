# Aristotle-Number-Puzzle

The Aristotle Number Puzzle is an octogonal grid with 19 cells, where each cell must contain a unique integer 1 - 19. To solve the puzzle, one must find an arrangement such that each straight line of cells adds to 38. The following is an unsolved puzzle:

The numbers in this diagram represent the path taken in my approach to solve the problem. Specifically, the numbers represent the node depth in a depth-first search. My approach is as follows:

Approach:
1. Set up a DFS algorithm to find each valid arrangement of numbers into the given positions. Begin with every possible configuration (19! possible configurations, or 1.2e17), then perform checks to limit the depth of branches.
2. Create the list of checks and implement them for their corresponding depths.
3. If all checks are passed at depth 19, print the configuration (12 solutions due to symmetry).

To optimize the run time and avoiding evaluating 19! configurations, as many checks as possible should be performed as early as possible. This is why I chose a path wrapping around the perimeter of the octogon, to implement a check at least every three node depths. The checks are as follows:

Checks:
1. sum of nodes(1,2,3) = 38 (depth = 3)
2. sum of nodes(3,4,5) = 38 (depth = 5)
3. sum of nodes(2,6) <= 35 (depth = 6) *
4. sum of nodes(5,6,7) = 38 (depth = 7)
5. sum of nodes(1,7) <= 32 (depth = 7) **
6. sum of nodes(4,8) <= 35 (depth = 8) *
7. sum of nodes(7,8,9) = 38 (depth = 9)
8. sum of nodes(3,9) <= 32 (depth = 9) **
9. sum of nodes(2,10) <= 35 (depth = 10) *
10. sum of nodes(6,10) <= 35 (depth = 10) *
11. sum of nodes(9,10,11) = 38 (depth = 11)
12. sum of nodes(5,11) <= 32 (depth = 11) **
13. sum of nodes(1,11,12) = 38 (depth = 12)
14. sum of nodes(4,12) <= 32 (depth = 12) **
15. sum of nodes(8,12) <= 32 (depth = 12) **
16. sum of nodes(4,12,13,14) = 38 (depth = 14)
17. sum of nodes(2,6,14,15) = 38 (depth = 15)
18. sum of nodes(4,8,15,16) = 38 (depth = 16)
19. sum of nodes(6,10,16,17) = 38 (depth = 17)
20. sum of nodes(8,12,17,18) = 38 (depth = 18)
21. sum of nodes(2,10,13,18) = 38 (depth = 18)
22. sum of nodes(5,11,15,18,19) = 38 (depth = 19)

*(other 2 in row can be 1 and 2 at minimum)

**(other 3 in row can be 1, 2, and 3 at minimum)

A timer was added to test the effectiveness of the checks on the runtime.
